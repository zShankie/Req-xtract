# 🚀 Req-Xtract
![Req-xtract Demo](./docs/demo.png)
Req-Xtract is an 🤖 AI-powered tool designed to automate the extraction and classification of software requirements from Meeting Minutes (MoM) PDFs. It significantly accelerates the 📜 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) creation process using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model and Groq for refinement.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Extracts **Introduction, Scope, and Architecture** sections from MoM PDFs.
- 🏷️ Classifies requirements into **Functional Requirements (FR)** and **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.
- 📚 Processes multiple PDF files to generate a **single IEEE-standard SRS document**.
- 🔍 Enhances FR/NFR refinement using **Groq**.
- 🎨 Utilizes **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- 📊 Includes a **comparative study** showcasing the efficiency of AI-assisted SRS creation versus traditional methods.
